# Scaling Design: High-Throughput gRPC Report Generation Service

## Objective
Scale the gRPC-based report generation service to handle **10,000 concurrent requests per second** across **multiple data centers**, while maintaining high availability, consistency, and observability.

---

##  1. System Architecture Overview

### a. Microservices Pattern
- Service is stateless; each instance handles report generation.
- Statelessness allows **horizontal scaling** easily.

### b. Infrastructure
- Deploy using **Kubernetes (GKE, EKS, etc.)** for autoscaling and failover.
- Use **Service Mesh** (e.g., Istio or Linkerd) for fine-grained traffic routing, mTLS, and telemetry.

### c. Deployment Model
- **Multi-region Kubernetes clusters**, managed through **federated control plane**.
- Use **Global Load Balancer** (e.g., Google Cloud Load Balancer or AWS ALB + Route 53) to distribute traffic to nearest cluster.

---

##  2. Load Balancing Strategy

### a. Client-side Load Balancing (gRPC-specific)
- Use **gRPC client load balancer** with **round-robin** or **pick-first** policy.
- For internal services, use **xDS** and **Envoy proxy** for advanced routing.

### b. External Load Balancing
- Use **L4 TCP Load Balancer** in front of each regional cluster.
- Global DNS-level or HTTP(S) LB for multi-region traffic steering (latency-based routing, failover).

---

##  3. Concurrency & Throughput

- Use **Go netpoller**, `sync.Pool`, and tune **GOMAXPROCS**.
- Use **connection pooling** for PostgreSQL (e.g., `pgxpool` or `gorm` settings).
- Implement **backpressure and circuit breakers** with retries and deadlines in gRPC clients.

---

##  4. Persistence Layer (PostgreSQL)

### a. Scale PostgreSQL
- Use **read replicas** and **connection pooling**.
- Use **partitioned tables** or **sharding** (e.g., Citus) for high insert throughput.
- Alternatively: move to **cloud-native distributed SQL** like **CockroachDB** or **Spanner**.

---

##  5. Reliability & Resilience

- Use **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)** based on custom metrics (CPU, QPS, gRPC latency).
- Deploy with **PodDisruptionBudgets**, **liveness/readiness probes**.
- Enable **rate-limiting** and **request queuing** in front of gRPC services.
- Use **Kafka or Pub/Sub** if async generation is acceptable for higher throughput.

---

##  6. Observability

- **Logging**: Continue with Zap, aggregate with **ELK or Loki**.
- **Metrics**: Use **Prometheus + Grafana** for CPU/QPS/latency tracking.
- **Tracing**: Enable **OpenTelemetry** with gRPC interceptors to trace requests end-to-end.

---

##  7. CI/CD and Testing

- GitHub Actions for CI.
- Canary deployments with ArgoCD or FluxCD.
- Load testing with **k6**, **ghz**, or **wrk**.

##  Summary

| Concern         | Solution |
|----------------|----------|
| Throughput      | Horizontal autoscaling, gRPC optimization |
| Latency         | Global LB with multi-region k8s clusters |
| Persistence     | Scalable PostgreSQL or distributed DB |
| Observability   | OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Zap |
| Resilience      | Probes, retries, rate-limits, circuit breakers |
| Load Balancing  | gRPC LB + Envoy + DNS-based geo routing |

##  Technologies Recommended

- gRPC + Go
- PostgreSQL with GORM or pgx
- Kubernetes (multi-region)
- Envoy / Istio (service mesh)
- Prometheus + Grafana + OpenTelemetry
- GitHub Actions + ArgoCD
